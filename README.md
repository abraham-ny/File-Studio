# File Studio
**Most of the library code was ported from FileTool (open source library jar)**
***
DISCLOSURE: I did not intend to open source this project but whatever... here it is.<br>
The source code it'self is mostly self documented.
Most of the functions are implemented apart from **'premium'** features such as archive handling, upscaling of media content...<br>
***
# Contributing
## Building etc...
**Required JDK:** jdk1.8.0_361 AND JRE (same version)<br>
The project uses **JavaFX** as it's GUI platform
(i'm working on NetBeans IDE & SceneBuilder) so you might need to reconfig for your IDE<br>
Editing will be easy since most of the code is commented and also given obvious names (variables & methods).<br>
## What to contribute(code)
The unfinished parts are the ones that need most attention such as archive handling and image/video upscalling. Also any new features you may have in mind are welcome.<br>**ALSO** Most of the code is in ```FXMLDocumentController.java``` and it's respective ```fxml``` document which has the same name.<br>
